# homelab

### my own personal homelab stack and documentation

------

##### This repo consists of three different parts:

* Docker Compose files
* Configuration files
* This document

I am currently running this on my VPS, though it can be replicated anywhere. A domain name is **highly** recommended.

It is designed to be modular so that, unlike with many other stacks I've seen, you can more easily pick and choose what you want and manage everything more efficiently.

Be sure to carefully folow this docuentation if you plan on using this. I am happy to help if I am able.
